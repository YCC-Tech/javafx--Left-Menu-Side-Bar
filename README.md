# Left Menu Side Bar With Custom Windows Controls
JavaFX - Left Menu Side Bar with Custom Windows Controls

This is the template repo that you can use for your own javafx project. Initially, we have setup the UI and controls like below image.

We have
- added shadow around the window
- added custom minimize and close button
- added active state in menu items
- included custom font configurations and
- also included jMetro theme like Miscrosoft Fluent UI

Enjoy! :heart_eyes:
